# copyleft-oss-licensing

== OBJECTIVE ==

This is an attempt at taking open source licenses which are compliant
with the Open Source Initiative's Open Source Definition and making them
"copyleft". I am a busy man and I am far from being a lawyer, so I would
appreciate some help.


== INSPIRATION ==

This was inspired by the recent news regarding the Intel Management Engine
included in recent Intel CPUs. Intel Management Engine runs a BSD-licensed
version of MINIX and, because Intel has decided to lock down the firmware,
it is difficult for end-users and security researchers to review and patch
the code that makes it work; this is worrying because several security
flaws were discovered in Intel Management Engine and - even worse! - Intel
Management Engine can provide a backdoor to viewing everything on your
system (RAM, CPU state, etc.) for anyone who knows how to access it. Intel
isn't the only company that includes such a major flaw in their CPUs: most
manufacturers, including AMD, include something similar. One of the ways
we can combat this is to take the open source software these companies
rely on and re-license them in a way that requires the manufacturers to
respect the freedom of the end-user.


== ORGANIZATION ==

Each license is given it's own directory. For licenses with multiple
   incarnations, such as the BSD licenses, sub-directories might be present
   to help differentiate them. Each license will have two versions available:

	<name>+1: Clause added to ensure that source code is available
                  and can be modified without fear of litigation.
	<name>+2: Same as above, plus another clause added to ensure the
                  right to remove and/or reinstall.
